Overview
The AlphaFold Project is a molecular prediction application that allows users to submit protein sequences in FASTA format to an HPC (High-Performance Computing) environment for processing using AlphaPulldown. The results are retrieved and visualized using integrated tools like PyMOL.

The application supports both CPU and GPU job submissions, providing flexibility in how computational resources are utilized. It integrates with external databases via API calls, allowing users to retrieve and display molecular structures and related data directly within the app.
